# Wednesday, February 19th Lecture

``` python
# Generate num(candidate primes)
for num in range(start, end, step)
  #check the divisors
  for div in range(2,num/2 + 1):
    if num % div is divisible
      print (         )
      break
    #save the prime number
```
Example of printing columns and rows:
``` python
mtable = {{2, 3, 11], [5, 78, 99], [5777, 9978, 99]]:
for row in mtable:
  for elt in row:
    print (elt, " ", end = "")
  print()
```
* ISSUE: not in columns because it is only separated by a space--> not formatted correctly

# Questions

What is the difference between break and continue?
  * Continue: go to the top of the loop
  * Break: get out of the loop completely
